How to use Grab Objects.lua

Grab Objects.lua allows you to list and examine details about the currently loaded objects
from two (of likely three+) object models in DK64. 

"List" shows all currently loaded objects from that model
"Examine" shows all known details about the currently selected object

Keyboard shortcuts:

c = Cycle Grab Script mode
v = Grab an object (only works when examining/listing object model 1)
b = Focus the camera on an object (only works when examining/listing object model 1)
n = Previous object
m = Next object

Model 1 contains Actors, for example:
- Player
- Camera
- Enemies & Bosses
- Blueprints
- Boss keys (except key 8)
- Banana fairies
- Bonus barrels
- Boulders/Barrels
- Rainbow coin pads
- Cutscene and Bonus Barrel controllers
- Loading zone controller
- Fake Kongs (caged, DKRAP, test room, cutscenes)
- Balloons

Model 2 contains lightweight objects, for example:
- Gold Bananas
- Key 8
- Banana coins
- Colored Bananas (singles & bunches)
- Ammo crates
- Crystal coconuts
- Bananaporters
- Instrument pads
- Bullet switches
- Simian Slam switches
- Gorilla Grab levers

Even on maps with no Model 2 objects loaded, eg. main menu, the game allocates the object model 2 array with a minimum capacity of 450 objects or 0x90 * 450 or 0xFD20
Larger maps, eg. Japes, have array object model 2 array sizes over 450

It is currently unknown where the following objects are stored:
- Butterflies
- Fish
- etc etc

Butterflies use standard bone arrays to render

Stuff you can toggle with the lua console:

encircle_enabled (boolean) - Circles objects from the currently selected object model around the player, warning: crashy & laggy
rat_enabled (boolean) - Sets the animation timers for the player randomly
hide_non_scripted (boolean) - Hides model 2 objects without special behavior scripts
