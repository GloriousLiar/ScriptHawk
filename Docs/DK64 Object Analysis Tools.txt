How to use the DK64 object analysis tools

These tools allow you to list and examine details about the currently loaded objects
from two (of likely three+) object models in DK64.

"List" shows all currently loaded objects from that model
"Examine" shows all known details about the currently selected object

Keyboard shortcuts:

c = Cycle mode
v = Grab an object (only works when examining/listing object model 1)
b = Focus the camera on an object (only works when examining/listing object model 1)
n = Previous object
m = Next object
z = Zip to selected object, works with both model 1 and model 2

Model 1 contains Actors, for example:
	- Player
	- Camera
	- Enemies & Bosses
	- Blueprints
	- Boss keys (except key 8)
	- Banana fairies
	- Bonus barrels
	- Boulders/Barrels
	- Rainbow coin pads
	- Cutscene and Bonus Barrel controllers
	- Loading zone controller
	- Fake Kongs (caged, DK Rap, test room, cutscenes)
	- Balloons

Model 2 contains lightweight objects, for example:
	- Gold Bananas
	- Key 8
	- Banana coins
	- Colored Bananas (singles & bunches)
	- Ammo crates
	- Crystal coconuts
	- Bananaporters
	- Instrument pads
	- Bullet switches
	- Simian Slam switches
	- Gorilla Grab levers

Even on maps with no Model 2 objects loaded, eg. main menu, the game allocates the object model 2 array with a minimum capacity of 450 objects or 0x90 * 450 or 0xFD20
Larger maps, eg. Japes, have array object model 2 array sizes over 450

It is currently unknown where the following objects are stored:
- Butterflies
- Fish
- etc etc

Butterflies use standard bone arrays to render

Model 3 documentation
Training grounds there is an object of size 0x60 (0x433A00, may change) containing:
	- Group Type (0x00)
		- 0x02 = Fish
		- 0x03 = Butterflies
	- Number of members (0x02)
	- Unknown Pointer (0x04)
	- Pointer to bone array (0x08)

Stuff you can toggle with the lua console:

encircle_enabled (boolean) - Circles objects from the currently selected object model around the player, warning: crashy & laggy
rat_enabled (boolean) - Sets the animation timers for the player randomly
hide_non_scripted (boolean) - Hides model 2 objects without special behavior scripts

I'll probably add UI for this stuff in the future.
