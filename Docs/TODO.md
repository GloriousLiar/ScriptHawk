# ScriptHawk TODO list
## High Priority
- Blank template that's more lightweight
- Save and Load settings from a config file on disk
	- Joypad/Keyboard binds for D-Pad and L Button
	- Rounding precision
	- Rotation units
	- Mode? Arguable
	- Warnings/UITest?

- DK64:

	- Increase identifyMemory() coverage

## Low priority, recurring, or waiting:
